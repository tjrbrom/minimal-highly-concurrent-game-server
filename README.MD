# Simple, minimal highly-concurrent game server.

This project exists either to be reused as a template and extended, or to get an idea of how you can start building a highly concurrent server,
aimed mainly at servicing online multiplayer gaming.

This project is in an early stage of development.
I plan to add more features and utilize them in more specific implementations, for demonstration and experimentation, as well as showing you how to take advantage of this particular set up.

To get an idea of what's going on, check `server/src/main/java/com/server/launcher/GameLauncher.java`

This is the application entry point and shows how configuration, Vert.x, database initialization, and HTTP deployment are set up.
